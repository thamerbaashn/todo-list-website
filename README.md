# To-Do List Website  

This is a simple **To-Do List website** I built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project was part of a course assignment, and I used it to practice basic front-end development.  

## What I Learned
- How to create a simple layout with **HTML & CSS**  
- How to use **JavaScript** to add, edit, and delete tasks  
- How to save data using **localStorage**

## Next Steps
I plan to keep improving it by:  
- Adding deadlines for tasks  
- Marking tasks as completed  
- Making the design more modern
